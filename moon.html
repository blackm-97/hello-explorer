      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <p>
        The Moon is Earth’s closest neighbor in space, and it’s the only place humans have visited beyond our planet! It’s about a quarter the size of Earth and orbits around our planet once every 27.3 days. The Moon doesn't have any air, so there’s no weather, and it doesn’t have liquid water on its surface either. Instead, it’s covered in dust and rocky materials, with huge, flat plains called "maria" and lots of craters from space rocks that have hit it over millions of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        One fun fact is that the Moon causes the tides on Earth. Because of its gravity, it pulls on Earth’s oceans, making them rise and fall—this is called the "tidal effect." Another cool tidbit is that the Moon always shows the same face to Earth! This is because it rotates on its axis at the same rate it orbits Earth, a phenomenon known as "synchronous rotation."

        So, the next time you look up at the Moon, remember that it’s not just a pretty light in the sky—it has some fascinating secrets of its own!
