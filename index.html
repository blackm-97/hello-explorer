        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one we know of that has life! It’s the perfect place for plants, animals, and humans to live because it has air to breathe, water to drink, and just the right temperature. Earth is made up of land, water, and air. About 71% of the planet is covered in water, mostly oceans, with the remaining 29% being land, where we find mountains, forests, deserts, and cities.

        Earth also has a special "skin" called the atmosphere, which protects us from harmful space radiation and helps keep the temperature just right. And even though Earth spins around every 24 hours, the force of gravity keeps everything firmly grounded, so we don’t fly off!
